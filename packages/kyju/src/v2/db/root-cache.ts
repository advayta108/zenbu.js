/**
 * Authoritative in-memory copy of the root document, with coalesced disk
 * persistence.
 *
 * The root document is a single JSON file holding all top-level state. Two
 * properties of that design force this cache:
 *
 *  1. Reads must be O(1). Hot paths (write handlers, ref-checks, replica
 *     connect) need the current root cheaply; reading and parsing a JSON
 *     file per access scales poorly with both root size and access rate.
 *
 *  2. Writes amplify file IO: the whole document is rewritten on every
 *     mutation. With many small mutations arriving close together, doing a
 *     full read-modify-write per mutation produces work proportional to
 *     N × file_size, even when the actual change is tiny. Serializing those
 *     rewrites through a mutex (necessary for atomicity) further multiplies
 *     wall time as later writers wait for earlier ones to drain.
 *
 * The cache addresses both: in-process readers see an always-up-to-date
 * object reference, and writers update memory immediately while a single
 * deferred flush coalesces an arbitrary number of in-tick mutations into
 * one disk write.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   • `read()` returns the current state — including any mutations that
 *     completed earlier in the same fiber.
 *   • `set()` updates memory atomically (callers hold rootMutex around
 *     read+set) and schedules a flush; it does not await disk.
 *   • `flush()` blocks until the cache's current state is on disk; safe
 *     to call any time, idempotent when nothing is pending.
 *   • Disk writes acquire the same rootMutex as logical writes, so on-disk
 *     state can never reflect a torn intermediate object.
 *
 * Durability tradeoff: a write that has returned but not been flushed
 * survives an in-process failure (still in memory) but not a process death
 * (gone with the heap). Callers that need disk-on-return must call
 * `flush()` explicitly. Shutdown paths should always flush.
